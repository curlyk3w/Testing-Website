Hello, I am a new programmer. I'm not sure I can call myself a programmer. I've only been learning HTML for two months now, with no pressure. 
Coding is an interesting topic for me, so I'm doing some relaxing learning in my free time. 
And I would like to create a website for myself to use as a portfolio toÂ applying to universities.
